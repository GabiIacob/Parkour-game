# Parkour-game
Parkour-game is a 3D application developed to understand and explore the fundamentals of 3D graphics programming.
The project focuses on rendering, transformations, and basic player movement in a 3D environment.

It was built using C# and the OpenTK graphics library.

🎮 Description

The game simulates a simple parkour-style environment where the player can move and jump across platforms in a 3D space.
The main goal of the project is educational: learning how 3D graphics work under the hood rather than creating a fully polished game.
